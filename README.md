# adsabs_pdf_grab: A python function to download .pdf files for BibTeX entries using the ADS API.

This Python function takes a BibTeX file as input, parses each entry, identifies the DOI and or arXiv ID, and uses these with the [NASA Astrophysics Data System](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/) API to download a .pdf file for each entry. This allows the user to easily download .pdf files for all papers/articles/etc that they have in a .bib file, which, for example, they might have for an individual project, or a master file containing all papers that they cite in their work.

Input parameters:
 - A .bib file containing BibTeX entries. BibTeX entries can easily be generated on the ADS page for a given paper by going to View > Export Citation and "Select Export Format: BibTeX"; these entries can then be pasted into a .bib file, commonly used for citation management with LaTeX.
 - A valid ADS API token, which can be generated by signing up for/logging into an ADS account and visiting [this page in account settings](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/user/settings/token).
 - The directory to download the .pdf files to. By default, this is the current working directory.

The user can also silence text prints to terminal (notifying the user of the success or failure of .pdf downloads) using the `verbose` boolean argument (default True), as well as if existing .pdf files should be redownloaded and overwritten (with the `overwrite` boolean argument, which is False by default).
